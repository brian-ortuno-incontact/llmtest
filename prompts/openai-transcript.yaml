agent: Thank you for calling Acme Auto Parts Salvage, Inc. This is Jose, how can I assist you today?

caller: Hi, I'm Sarah Johnson. I need to find a transmission for a 2005 Ford F150.

agent: Sure thing, Sarah. I can definitely help you with that. Do you have a preference for a new or a rebuilt
transmission?

caller: I'm not sure. What's the difference?

agent: A new transmission is one that has never been used before and comes directly from the manufacturer. A rebuilt
transmission, on the other hand, is one that has been disassembled, inspected, and repaired to meet original equipment
specifications. Rebuilt transmissions are often more affordable than new ones.

caller: Okay, I see. What about financing options for a new transmission?

agent: We do offer financing options through a third-party lender. I can provide you with more information on that if
you're interested.

caller: Yes, please. That would be great.

agent: Sure thing. So, while I gather that information for you, can I also get you a quote for a replacement gas tank
for a 2003 Honda Civic?

caller: Yes, that would be helpful.

agent: Okay, I'll get that for you too. And lastly, do you have a recommendation for a shop that can replace the
windshield for a 2007 Toyota Camry?

caller: Yes, that would be great. I'm not familiar with shops in the area.

agent: Sure thing. I can provide you with some recommendations for shops that specialize in foreign cars.

caller: Thank you.

agent: Of course. So, for the transmission, we have both new and rebuilt options available. A new transmission for a
2005 Ford F150 would cost around $3,500, while a rebuilt transmission would cost around $2,500.

caller: That's a big difference in price. What would you recommend?

agent: It really depends on your budget and how long you plan to keep the vehicle. If you plan to keep
