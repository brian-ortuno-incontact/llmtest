Agent,[laughter].
Customer,Because we didn't order it.
Agent,Well just.
Agent,Correct # # # # #.
Customer,# # # # # # # more piece of background okay my wife is [NAME] and uh she ordered [PRODUCT] subscription and she pays a [CURRENCY] a month which is a [ALPHA] from her checking and that.
Agent,Over.
Agent,<unk>.
Agent,<unk>.
Agent,[laughter].
Agent,Okay.
Customer,We ordered.
Agent,<unk>.
Agent,[laughter].
Customer,But at the same time someone started charging my checking account I don't know how they got my information and it's something we don't use [ORG] and it's something we don't want so I don't know how that happened.
Agent,[laughter].
Agent,[laughter].
Agent,Oh.
Agent,<unk>.
Agent,Okay and just to a clarify um on the time you notice that there is a [PRODUCT] uh this could be under the invoice or or receipt on your checking account can you like to try to check if you are seeing the [ALPHA] a number.
Customer,Huh.
Agent,[laughter].
Customer,Okay I'm gonna stand my.
Agent,Sure sure.
Customer,Gotta login again it's just timed out.
Agent,Okay I'll be I'll be standing by here no worries.
Customer,Give you about.
Agent,[laughter].
Agent,Yes.
Agent,[laughter].
Agent,[laughter].
Agent,He.
Agent,<unk>.
Customer,Oh.
Agent,[laughter].
Customer,Okay here we go it's a debit card withdrawal [ORG].
Agent,Huh.
Customer,Or [ORG] [ALPHA] slash help pay pound [ALPHA].
Agent,[laughter].
Agent,[laughter] oh.
Agent,Oh.
Customer,And then it has the last four digits of my credit card # # # #.
Agent,Bye.
Customer,The charges go anywhere from [CURRENCY] dollars a month.
Agent,There's no like [ALPHA] a number information that you are seeing.
Customer,No.
Agent,Because for [ORG] there should be like [ALPHA] a details.
Agent,Oh.
Customer,No it's just a there's a [ALPHA].
Customer,And a card [ALPHA] I don't see any other identifying information on this.
Agent,[laughter].
Agent,Yeah.
Agent,Huh.
Agent,[laughter].
Agent,[laughter].
Agent,[laughter].
Agent,[laughter].
Customer,Why is it that the people who are taking the money out of my account I can't tell me who ordered it and when.
Agent,Huh.
Agent,Well um yeah if you were um to explain that from.
Agent,Earth early the.
Customer,Well I don't need it explained I just needed it stock.
Agent,Yeah.
Customer,I mean you would think that if you can't tell me who ordered it that that would be some indication that it's an un authorized it transaction.
Agent,Huh.
Agent,Huh well if that would be the case because even if I tried looking up for the information because before us to really like provide details how it was purchased we need the right account or right payment information but it's an authorized one.
Agent,Plus it's a [ORG] charge which is a third party builder we might have like limited access to it that's why only a walk through that we can provide but I didn't expect that you were in like provided a well walk through before you got into me and the real like last resort to fully put a stop on it.
Agent,Is by filing a dispute with your bank.
Customer,Well my bank who will not help I've been to them twice.
Agent,[laughter].
Agent,Mhm.
Agent,Bye bye.
Customer,And uh.
Agent,<unk> [laughter].
Customer,They're saying that I have to call you to get it to stop that if they have if you have my bank information which you do that that is prove to them that I authorized it unless I can prove otherwise.
Agent,Okay.
Agent,[laughter].
Customer,And I don't know how you got my bank information 'cause I didn't give it it was obtained through some other party.
Agent,[laughter].
Agent,Sure.
Customer,And now you can't tell me who that other party was and I can't prove to my bank that I didn't authorize it because you have the information so it's a catch # #.
Agent,[laughter].
Agent,<unk>.
Agent,<unk>.
Agent,# # # things like disputing it with a bank either to file it as fraud for filing it as fraud it'll require to change your card number but for filing a dispute there will be an investigation only so they'll keep your card number the same but with that investigation for the dispute once that happens they'll send a letter and it's going to be our back and we will reply to them to really find out who the corporate is.
Customer,Yep.
Agent,Well you can tell to your bank that you did talk to to representative already for [ORG] support.
Customer,Thank.
Agent,And we tried really locating it but no locked and we suggested you to file a dispute instead.
Customer,Right.
Agent,Because that will be our only way to really you know help your bank at finding the corporate how this is happened to your account because the only thing that you will get charged for this type of subscription if there is a sign up on the web on the app.
Customer,Okay.
Customer,<unk>.
Agent,Or on a third party Biller um using your information and whoever that person is the one that we're gonna try to find out once the dispute is started with your bank.
Customer,<unk>.
Customer,[laughter] yeah well you keep saying I have to go to the bank the bank says I gotta go to you.
Agent,Well um it's just like convincing them that um you already talked to us twice referred locating any and that you were advice by us.
Agent,They just really need like need a confirmation about it so you talk to us twice already huh and and.
Customer,Well yeah.
Customer,They don't care because it's not their problem.
Customer,I've already been to them twice about this.
Agent,Um not so.
Agent,Well if I will be your bank representative I wouldn't like tell you that kinda stuff because if you were.
Customer,Yeah well that's what they I've been to him twice and that's exactly what they said they said sorry we can't help it that's just the rules and the only thing you can do is close your bank account.
Agent,What.
Customer,So that's where we are and I'm about ready to close my account and close my.
Customer,[ORG] account.
Agent,[laughter].
Agent,I'll <unk> try one more.
Customer,'cause now it doesn't matter if it's a small charge I'm getting really angry.
Agent,Huh well I I'll try to stretch further my resource is for this [ORG] charge I'll try to get access to [ORG] articles okay maybe I can provide you a walk through the right walk through on how we can really cancel it if we are able to locate it okay if you don't mind give me two to three minutes I'll place the call on hold but I'll get back okay.

Customer,[DATE] for [CURRENCY].
Agent,[CURRENCY] um.
Agent,This could be a [PRODUCT].
Agent,But not a subscription because we don't have like [CURRENCY] dollars amount plan on our side starting price is [CURRENCY].
Agent,Either this could be like a game purchase for [PRODUCT] character for a games on [ORG] or like one time.
Customer,Okay.
Customer,Well we don't do games yeah we don't do games and um yeah it says [PRODUCT].
Agent,Oh.
Customer,Um yeah and it's billed to my checking account and I I don't do any games and I have no games at all now if my wife ordered the game and it automatically went to my checking account by mistake.

Customer,Yeah I you know I I I would doubt very much that it's fraudulent I just think it's a mistake.
Customer,And it's costing me soap far an hour and a half today of productive time to get it fixed.
Agent,<unk>.
Agent,So sorry I mean we we tried our best we even tried to walk through so the.
Customer,Yeah well it just doesn't seem fair that everyone's gonna say you know you just have to live with these charges that you didn't re auto arise and and people are going into my checking account and just taking what they want and I can't do anything about it except.
Agent,Last report it's really.
Agent,Huh.

Agent,Alright.
Agent,I'm really a sorry a then.
Customer,Well.
Agent,Everything's exhausted already from my end as well.
Customer,Okay all right all right all right it's if this is our new reality where corporations can just go take money from whoever they want whenever they need it um then this tear any is what we deserve.
Agent,Okay.
Customer,Um I didn't vote for it.
Agent,[laughter].
Agent,Yeah we also like you know been doing like dealing with this fraudster because of a fraud is really everywhere that's what I can tell but um we failed locating it here from my end unfortunately.
Customer,Yeah and what's if they have this information and they already have this authorization and the bank isn't gonna do anything about it.
Agent,<unk>.
Customer,They could go in and take my entire balance if they want and I'd still have no recourse.
Agent,[laughter].
Agent,And I'm really not so sure why your bank is not huh because if oh huh I did like.
Customer,They're saying this is what [PRODUCT] terms are and there's nothing they can do about it that's what they're saying.
Agent,Not so sure there's never been like a an update because I've been I I worked with the financial before.
Agent,For credit cards and debit card including checking see if there's like a fraud.
Customer,Well if you can if you can if you can find a solution.
Agent,Huh.
Customer,The then fine I'd let me know.

Agent,That information as fraudster may really like.
Agent,Took the information for your checking account.
Customer,Yeah alright well again I don't think it's a fraud I think it's just a mistake and I can't get any resolution to it so now it's fraud alright have a good day.
