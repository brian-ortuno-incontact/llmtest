Customer,"Hi I was calling, um because I have the add on for [PRODUCT], which is no ads um and I've had it for probably about a year now and I've called before about this issue and I still have ads on all the [PRODUCT] shows I watch on the movies."
Agent,Okay I'm sorry to hear that you're subscribed to the who no ads plan but still getting ads I'll be more than happy to take a look at your current subscription with you today but first can I ask you nothing came through the automated system what is the email address is gonna be associate with the account that we're gonna be reviewing today can you please spell that for me slowly and phonetically to make sure I get that correct.
Customer,[laughter].
Customer,Yes it's [ALPHA].
Customer,[ALPHA] sorry I don't know the static helpful but um.
Customer,[ALPHA] it's a [EMAIL].
Agent,Thank you so much one moment please while I tend to see if I can locate an account with this information.
Customer,<unk>.
Agent,And can I ask who have the pleasure of speaking with you over the phone today could have your first and last name.
Customer,It's [NAME].
Agent,Thank you so much and in order for me to take any action on an account or leased any detailed information I do have to be verify the services so can I ask you some additional verification questions please for security purposes.
Customer,Yeah.
Agent,Thank you so much like how are you currently being billed for your subscription.
Customer,Um like monthly or.
Agent,Um more specific question would be like um are you being billed through a third party that's linked to your billing like [PRODUCT] or do you put like a credit or debit card on file.
Customer,Oh I have a debit card on [PRODUCT] account.
Agent,Okay and what is that card type and the last four of that card number please.
Customer,It's a [ORG] and it's # # # #.
Agent,Perfect thank you so much for taking time to verify this information with me today I really do appreciate it a with that being said I understand you're calling in because you're just trying to stream some [PRODUCT] content but you seem to be getting ads when you subscribe to the no ads plan is that correct.
Customer,<unk>.
Customer,Yes.
Agent,Okay let's see we take a look at your subscription here.
Agent,Can I ask you just um do you have any like um [ORG] titles that you kind of have off the top of your head that you're receiving these ads on by any chance.
Customer,Um well I'm watching a movie right now like the hunger games and it's on TV S and.
Customer,Uh I I get I just started watching those movie and I had like a two minute add and then if I watch shows like my regular shows that I watch like survivor the challenge I'll be watching those shows and I get ads on those as well.
Agent,Okay and so yeah you're absolutely right so right now it does look like you are subscribed to whom no ads plan plus live TV so what it sounds like is that uh you're currently streaming so with live TV um since we don't own that content and we're just kinda working with them uh like those networks we don't have the ability to remove ads off of anything that is associate with life TV so let's say like [ORG] like [ORG] or [ORG] of um if they're streaming anything you will subject to adds to that and anything that they might allow through our on demand content if your scrolling and you see like in the bottom right corner a network name or then [PRODUCT] then it's possible that it will still have the ads just 'cause we legally uh don't own the license to that content so that will still be add supported more than likely now if you're streaming anything through our actual [PRODUCT] library and you come across in the bottom right corner it has a [PRODUCT] logo that should not have any ads are you able to kinda confirm that for me like by going to anything that's [PRODUCT] related and seeing if you're able to stream that without any ads.
Customer,Yeah so if it's only [PRODUCT] shows that don't have the add.
Agent,That's actually correct yeah anything that's who owned which should not have any ads through it.
Customer,Oh this whole time I've been thinking like it was on.
Customer,Like any show that I watch so if it has like.
Agent,[laughter].
Customer,So if it doesn't have a thing at the corner it will not have add.
Agent,[laughter].
Agent,That's correct and the bottom.
Customer,Like if there's nothing in the corner.
Agent,Uh there should be something in the corner normally it'll say like [PRODUCT] like if you go to the like our [PRODUCT] homepage and your scrolling down if you look at the bottom right corner there should be a logo there more than likely it's gonna be either like if it's associated life TV it'll be a network and then that'll let you know all this more than likely is gonna have ads but if you see the [PRODUCT] stamped logo you should know there should be no ad.
Customer,<unk> 'cause some of these movies on browsing um they don't have anything at the bottom.
Agent,[laughter].
Agent,Uh which one in particular are you looking at that you're not seeing.
Customer,Um.
Customer,Like I was just browsing through the movies and like for instance the Juno movie.
Customer,Like [ALPHA] under ROM calms it doesn't have anything under Earth like in the corner or like the proposal crazy rich engines like all that stuff doesn't have T anything in the corner but then I see on other ones that have like [ORG] affects.
Agent,Yeah so that should tell you more less than a if you do see that that might have ads um let's see you're right when I pull up the notes here.
Agent,It does look like I don't see in the bottom right corner there but it does look like this might be some content we own if you click on that do you see any ads that pop up.
Customer,Um I don't know how to do that like what I just hit play and then scroll to see if there would be.
Agent,Yeah just place mine.
Agent,Another rule of thumb two is like you use a search engine if you just type in [PRODUCT] it'll pull up like our originals are [PRODUCT] network are [PRODUCT] exclusive and our our [PRODUCT] originals so that kinda also will show you that's what we that's our own content and that should be available to you with no ad then if you search anything through there.
Customer,Okay um I don't really watch a lot of like regular like I guess [PRODUCT] shows so I would have would I be able to just cancel that know add subscription just go back to like regular live TV.
Agent,<unk>.
Customer,With like the whole package just without ads or with ads.
Agent,Yeah so we do offer a plan a right now you're with the [PRODUCT] no ads plus live TV plan for [CURRENCY] we do offer the [PRODUCT] with ads and live TV and [PRODUCT] with ads for [CURRENCY] now um because of the legal verbiage and uh uh you know the the other um services connected I don't have the ability to do that here on my end but I can walk you through changing your plan right now if you'd like you have access to like a computer or laptop by any chance.
Customer,Oh I could do it also fair and I I know how to do it I just wasn't sure if it would be easier if you just do it over the phone but I could just do that.
Agent,Oh okay.
Agent,Yeah perfect if you yeah if you log into your a through web browser to your account you have full capability of managing your services more than I do so you can change your plan update your payment information of that nature but yeah you can change your plan to [PRODUCT] with live TV and that should save you some money there 'cause it's # # # # a month um if you don't mind the ads with a [PRODUCT] content.
Customer,Okay.
Customer,Yeah I watched enough ads on the regular stuff so just watching any more isn't really that bad.
Agent,How okay awesome well what other questions you have for me here today how?
Customer,Um that was it.
Agent,Awesome well I do have let you know that if you stay on the line I disconnect there's actually a short survey you can take it's just let my supervisor know how I'm doing today any feedback is always appreciated.
